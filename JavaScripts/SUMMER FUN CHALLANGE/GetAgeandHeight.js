/*Age and Height Check
Check if someone can ride a fun roller coaster! Ask for their age and height in
centimeters and save them in boxes. First check if their age is 12 or more. If it
is, check if their height is 140 or more. If both are true, say, “Ride allowed!” If
not, say, “Too young!” or “Too short!” Use choices inside choices.*/
