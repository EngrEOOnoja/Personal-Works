/*25.Password Retry
Guard a secret vault! Create a locked box called “correct password” set to
“python.” Give the user 3 tries to type a password, saving each try in a box.
Check if it matches the locked box. If it does, say, “Success!” and stop. If not,
say, “Try again!” After 3 wrong tries, say, “Locked out!” Use a choice and
repeat.*/
